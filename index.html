            <h2>Creating hardware that thinks — embedded systems & PCB design done right.</h2>
            <p> 
              I design reliable microcontroller-based systems, well-structured PCB layouts, 
              and integrated IoT solutions. My work spans from driver-level firmware and 
              high-speed digital interfaces to complete hardware platforms. I focus on building
              systems that are stable, efficient, and ready for real-world deployment.
